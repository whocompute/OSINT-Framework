# OSINT Framework

This is a slightly more up-to-date version of [OSINT-Framework](https://github.com/lockfale/osint-framework).

Mostly I'm just merging in pull requests from the main repo, because they don't get merged there anymore.

If you have an exciting new website you want included, just make a pull request here. HOWEVER, I can't guarentee
that it will be merged, as right now I'm mostly doing just removals.

You can see the original website [here](https://osintframework.com).

### Where to find stuff:

This site is now hosted at [whocompute.com/osint](https://whocompute.com/osint).
