# OSINT Framework

This is a more up-to-date version of [OSINT-Framework](https://github.com/lockfale/osint-framework).

Mostly I'm just merging in pull requests from the main repo, because they don't get merged there anymore.

If you have an exciting new website you want included, just make a pull request here.

You can see the original website [here](https://osintframework.com).

### Where to find stuff:

This site will hopefully soon be going up on my website [whocompute.com](https://whocompute.com).
